## Introduction
Hello! I am at the beginning of my journey to becoming a proficient data analyst. This repository serves as a log of my progress in learning MySQL. As I work through various projects, I am documenting my solutions and the skills I acquire along the way.

## Projects

### Data Cleaning
This project involves inserting, updating, and deleting data within a database. I practiced using `INSERT`, `UPDATE` and `DELETE` statements to manage data effectively.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
This project focuses on combining data from multiple tables using `JOIN` operations and retrieving data using subqueries or **CTE**s. The aim was to understand how to perform complex queries to extract meaningful information.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Writing basic SQL queries (`SELECT`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, `HAVING`)
- Designing normalized database schemas
- Performing data manipulation (`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`)
- Using `JOIN` operations, subqueries and **CTE**s to combine and analyze data
- Others:
  - Stored Procedures
  - Events
  - Temporary Tables
